        <p class="text-sm lg:text-base leading-snug mt-2.5">
          In some regions (like Canada), you have certain rights under
          applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to
          request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to
          request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of
          your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability;
          and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision
          that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by
          automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and
          offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances,
          you may also have the right to object to the processing of your
          personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by
          using the contact details provided in the section “HOW CAN YOU CONTACT
          US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?” below.

          If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
          information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on
          the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
          time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by
          using the contact details provided in the section “HOW CAN YOU CONTACT
          US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?” below.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm lg:text-base leading-snug mt-6">
          However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
          processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
          it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
          reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm lg:text-base leading-snug">
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
          Notice.
