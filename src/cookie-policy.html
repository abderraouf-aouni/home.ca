        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
        can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the

        which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies

        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and

        Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?

        Websites may also use so-called “Flash Cookies” (also known as Local
        Shared Objects or “LSOs”) to, among other things, collect and store
        information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for
        other site operations.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm lg:text-base leading-snug mt-6">
        If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust
        the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using
        the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also
        control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and
        following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain,
        for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to
        “Information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
        being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash
        Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being
        delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).

        Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit
        acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of
        some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used
